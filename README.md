## About The Project

Cat Collector allows any cat enthusiast to easily manage their feline companions through our cat-database application. No more wasting another one of your nine lives on an application that limits the number of cats one can own. No more worrying about the privacy of your beloved Mr. Fluffy-tinkle-kins. For thepurrrpose of using a pun, we have you covered...in cat hair.
